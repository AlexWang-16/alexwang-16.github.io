A lot of what I write comes from things I’ve learned while working on projects. Over the years, I’ve spent time with AWS Cloud, DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and software development. Back then, people stuck to very specific roles. Today, most companies expect engineers to know a bit of everything. It’s pretty common to get moved around wherever an extra set of hands or a new perspective is needed. Because of that, I see myself as a flexible software engineer who focuses more on solving problems than sticking to one stack or job title.

The posts you’ll see here are mostly me sharing new things I’m picking up, whether it’s from projects at work or experiments in my free time.

Generative AI has made it easier than ever to get work done. Large language models like ChatGPT and Claude can help speed up coding, catch bugs, and even act like a pair programming buddy when you want to bounce ideas around.

I’m excited that writing software feels a lot easier today than it used to. My goal is to make the most of these tools for learning and for building things faster.

In these posts, I’ll talk about the challenges I run into while using generative AI and the tricks I’ve found that help me work through them.
