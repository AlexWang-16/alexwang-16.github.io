I'm a senior data platform engineer working with Azure Functions, Jenkins CICD, and developing agentic artificial intelligence applications using LangChain and LangGraph written in Python. My goal in life is to build tools that empower people to be at their best and in doing so, change the world for the better.

I enjoy making espressos and tea, learning about design, history, and connecting with others.

I'm an avid believer in life long learning.
