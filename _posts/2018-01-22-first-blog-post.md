<div class="">

My open-source journey begins here. Yes, without even writing a single line of code. This blog is dedicated to documenting each adventure I undertake as I dive into the world of open-source.<br><br>

In fact, up until this moment, I've never used Wordpress before and I'm already impressed at how easy, yet customizable this platform is. So sit back as you watch me ride through the highs and lows while attempting to make the world a better place.<br><br>

I'm currently a third year student at Seneca College learning to become a useful contributor to the community's problems. With the guidance of <a href="https://twitter.com/humphd?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Humphrey</a>, I hope to break the ice into the open-source world, a place where I was afraid to enter as the thought of millions of lines of code were overwhelming.<br><br>

I hope you will find the things I've learned useful for you in solving the problems you encounter.<br><br>

Cheers to a brighter future.
